  <h2>The Story of Truco</h2>
  <div class="story-image-section">
    <div class="story-text">
      <p>Truco originated in Valencia, Spain, during the 16th century, where it was first played with the traditional Spanish deck . 
        The word Truco means "trick" in Spanish, reflecting the game's emphasis on bluffing, deception, and strategic moves — 
        traits that distinguish it from other card games of the time.</p>
      <p>The game crossed the Atlantic with Spanish settlers during the colonial period and quickly took root in South America, 
        particularly in Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Venezuela. As it spread, different regions began to adapt the rules and 
        create their own local variations — leading to the richly diverse styles of Truco played today.</p>
      <p>In Argentina, Truco became more than a game: it evolved into a cultural staple, often played in family gatherings, 
        bars, and rural taverns, accompanied by expressive gestures, witty banter, and bold psychological tactics. 
        It reflects not only the strategic mind of the player but also the spirited personality of Argentine popular culture.</p>
      <p>Over the centuries, Truco has endured as a symbol of tradition, social connection, and cunning gameplay, 
        and it remains one of the most beloved and widely played card games in the region.</p>
